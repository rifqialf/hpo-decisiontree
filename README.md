# Hyperparameter Optimization
This repository is my take on implementing Decision Tree using Dask and applying hyperparameter optimization to showcase my ability to use machine learning in Dask computing.

## Implementation
Download the Jupyter Notebook 'hpo_assignment.ipnyb'.

Upload the file to CRIB where the data is located (since moving the data is not convenient due to the very big size).

Run the cells accordingly.
